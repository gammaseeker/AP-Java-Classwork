A stitch in time saves nine.

A twitch of mine saves nine.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door,
Only this, and nothing more.

Months upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten law,
While I nodded, nearly rapping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at me chamber door.
It’s some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door,
Only this, and nothing sore.
